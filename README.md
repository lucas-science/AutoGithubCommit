# AutoGithubCommit
All devellopers have only one dream, this :

But **YOU**, you have a social life and you can't commit **ALL DAY** in your github account, so I have find a solution for you.\
The **AutoGithubCommit** is a program made to commit each day **in your place**.

You have just to execute this line command : 
``` sh
python main.py "YOUR GITHUB API TOKEN" "THE REPO WHERE YOU WILL COMMIT" "YOUR USERNAME" "main" "README.md" 
```

Ok, ok, it's a bit hard to copy and paste this command line **each day**, but I have the solution :\
* You just have to use a CRON TAB in [Windows](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7195503/setting-up-a-cron-job-in-windows) or [Linux](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_commands/crontab.htm) !, who is going to execute the command each day (as you have configurated him before :) )

Now, you can continue to have a social life and look like to an **hard worker** on GIHTUB !
